 *
 *  1: Executor
 *    An {@code Executor} is normally used
 *    instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than
 *    invoking {@code new Thread(new RunnableTask()).start()} for each
 *    of a set of tasks, you might use:
 *
 *  2: ExecutorService
 *     <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 *  * submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 *  * {@code ExecutorService}
 *
 *  3ï¼š newSingleThreadExecutor
 *      Creates an Executor that uses a single worker thread operating
 *      * off an unbounded queue. (Note however that if this single
 *      * thread terminates due to a failure during execution prior to
 *      * shutdown, a new one will take its place if needed to execute
 *      * subsequent tasks.)  Tasks are guaranteed to execute
 *      * sequentially, and no more than one task will be active at any
 *      * given time. Unlike the otherwise equivalent
 *      * {@code newFixedThreadPool(1)} the returned executor is
 *      * guaranteed not to be reconfigurable to use additional threads.
